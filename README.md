# Intro
Predicting river water potability is crucial for ensuring public health and environmental sustainability. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that leverages key water quality parameters like pH, temperature, BOD, and nitrate levels. By analyzing historical and current data, the model aims to evaluate water quality and forecast trends, offering actionable insights for effective water resource management and pollution control.
